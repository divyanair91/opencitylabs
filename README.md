Resume + IPython Notebook of Basic Project for conversation with Matt on 2/20.

The Film Permits Project is one example of a larger series that I am working on. The idea is to use the open data available through NYC to start a small media project (Instagram + Maybe a Blog) where each post tells a unique story about NYC in one quick/easy data visualization. It started as an opportunity for me to get to know how Open Data in NYC works and then I realized I had some really fascinating storytelling opportunities on my hands.

In this particular example, I played around with sample data from the Mayorâ€™s Office of Media and Entertainment (MOME) around Film Permits to get a sense of where movies are filmed in NYC. The {Film Permits Sample Project.ipynb} shows my basic cleaning and exploratory data analysis as well as some directions I could take this project if I wanted to work on a longer form piece for a blog in the future. The program is set up to use the Open Data API to automatically pull the latest available data.
